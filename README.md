# AcaBot - Music for the Masses
This is just a personal project for my Discord Server, if you have a problem running the bot please make sure you are using the correct version of python when trying to start it.

Python version 3.5.1

Use the run.bat file if you are on windows
Use the run.sh file if you are on mac (Haven't tested yet so if it is wrong either you have the wrong python version path or I just can't help you atm lol)

If run.sh or run.bat does not work try the following commands in the bot folder:
	
	python3 main.py

	python3.5 main.py
